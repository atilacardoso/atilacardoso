As someone with a passion for technology, I'm thrilled to be transitioning to a career in Cloud Computing and DevOps. 

With a background in project coordination, finance, and manufacturing, I've honed my skills in everything from operations and technical production to cloud computing projects.

As an Australian citizen with a diverse background, I bring a unique blend of experiences to the table. Born in Brazil and having spent eleven formative years in Japan, I've had the privilege of immersing myself in different cultures, each contributing to my personal and professional growth.

My time in Japan, renowned for its emphasis on discipline and attention to detail, has profoundly influenced my approach to work. It has ingrained in me a relentless pursuit of excellence and a strong work ethic that I bring to every challenge.

When I'm not diving into the latest tech trends, you'll find me on the Judo mat, perfecting my throws and techniques.
